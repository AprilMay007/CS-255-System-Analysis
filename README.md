# CS-255-System-Analysis
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

Laim, the owner of DriverPass wanted a program that was cloud based that allowed user to pick from three different packages. These packages would help people pass the written and driver test from the DMV. The program should allow the students to make reservations, modify if necessary and can practice tests. 

What did you do particularly well?

The activity diagram was the part I felt was done very well. Also, understanding the client’s needs and helping explain this information to the client was another thing I felt comfortable with. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The one thing that I would revise on my work would have been module Two Assignment with the functional and non-functional requirements. This would be something that I would like to dive into more and get a better understanding of it. Also, it would be nice to be able to know the difference between the two requirements better when working on a large-scale project. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Taking good notes of the interview and referring to them help with implementation of the system design and what the client wanted overall. There were some things that when designing the system, I thought could be system upgrades later down the road after the initial rollout of the program. The focus was designing what the client wanted and not what I thought they would want as upgrades or all together.  It was more about bringing their vision to life. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach was to take my time understanding the clients needs and then making some rough draft UML case diagram. The biggest takeaway was the Gnatt chart to help keep the project on task and ensure a timely delivery. Having used those and the business requirement documentation help layout what needs to be done and what the process is behind it all.
